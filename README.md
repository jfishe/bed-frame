Bed frame with bottom for Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR ERGO System

Our Main Coone kitten was pulling himself around underneath, shredding the Ergo platform. We also wanted to install an under-dresser, so a platform with frame was called for.

The dimesions for the bed were taken from the [TEMPUR ERGO system manual](https://www.tempurpedic.com/documents/4/ergo.pdf "TEMPUR®
 ERGO System™").
